It has 3 parts. First, sampling the RDD and create a RangePartitioner which results in a roughly even partition.(Quote from the document: Partitions sortable records range * equal ranges. Ranges determined sampling content of rdd passed in) Second part is mapping the data to shuffled bucket. Third, it adopts a distributed merge-sort. Merge sort each partition and reduce the outputs into one final result. Essentially, It will partition the data to each machine and reduce them by merging.
