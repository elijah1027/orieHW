Slider is used to show different plots. Side it to see different congress sessions. 

Blue line is connected when two democrats have the same votes for more than 50% of the rollcalls
Red line is connected when two republicans have the same votes for more than 50% of the rollcalls
Green line is connected when a democrat and a republican have the same votes for more than 50% of the rollcalls

We can see a lot of green lines in congress 100. This is the time when democrats and republicans agree on a lot of the issues.
In recent congress 115, we can see much less green lines compared to congress 100. It shows that U.S senators are more divided than ever.
